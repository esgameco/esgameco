### Chance Vodnoy

My main focus right now is on learning full-stack web development skills.
I'm interested in AI, game and web development.

I have the most experience in building APIs and scraping, as well as video composition in python.
I know how to use C++, python, javascript, and some others.
 
I am currently looking for an internship.
