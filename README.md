### Chance Vodnoy

My main focus right now is on learning full-stack web development skills.  
I'm interested in AI, game and web development.  

I have the most experience in building APIs and scraping, as well as video composition in python.  
I plan on doing at least one commit per day for the next month.

You can contact me at chancevodnoy129@gmail.com.  
I am currently looking for a job.
